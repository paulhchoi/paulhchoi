## How do you do, fellow coders ðŸ›¹

I'm a dev based in Philly, just throwing stuff at walls and seeing what sticks.

I work as a Software Engineer at [QVC](https://www.qvc.com/) on their Android app where I help develop for the Content Experience team. Most of my daily experimentation goes into [Metro Church's site](https://metrophilly.org/) where I serve as the Director of Digital Tech, and use stuff like React/Gatsby, Tailwind/Emotion, Sanity, & Netlify for the static site, and Java/SpringBoot, AWS, Postgres, & React/CRA, for the app/API.
